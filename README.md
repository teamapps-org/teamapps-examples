## Run Dev Environment in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Run the class `RunExample` by opening the class, 
clicking the green arrow before the class name 
and choosing 'Run...'. This generates an IntelliJ IDEA run configuration, 
which will fail when running for the first time. 

2. Right click on the `<Component>Example` class you want to run and choose `Copy reference`. 

3. Edit the `RunExample` run config and paste the class reference into `program arguments`. 

4. Optional: To customize the running port, set the env var `TEAMAPPS_EXAMPLES_PORT` 
to the port of your liking in the run config.
